"""
Extract directed agent-to-agent communication matrices from the MC1 dataset.

Two distinct kinds of directed agent-to-agent links are extracted:

  1. Direct replies — resolved from the structured "recipients" /
     "responding_to" fields (who a message was actually addressed to).
  2. @ mentions — agents also reference each other inline in message
     "content" using short role tags (e.g. "@legal", "@pr_intern"), which
     may name agents beyond the formal recipients list. These are found by
     regex-scanning content for "@<role>" tokens and mapping them through
     the same ROLE_TO_AGENT table used for recipients.

Data quirks handled (discovered by inspecting MC1_final_00.json):
  - Each round has a top-level "communications" list (not nested under
    "agent_outputs" as the README sketch suggests).
  - Most messages carry an explicit "recipients" list, using role names
    ("legal", "platform_trust", "pr", "social_manager", "pr_intern",
    "intern", "judge") rather than agent_ids, plus the sentinel "ALL"
    meaning "broadcast to every other agent".
  - The sender's own role is called "social_media" in agent_role, but the
    *recipient* alias for that same agent is spelled "social_manager" in
    other messages' recipients lists. Both are mapped to social_media_agent.
    The same alias quirk shows up in @ mention tags too (content uses
    "@social_manager", never "@social_media").
  - Some one_on_one_chat messages have an empty "recipients" list but a
    "responding_to" field that references another message's message_id.
    For those, the recipient is inferred as the sender of the message being
    replied to.
  - Public posts (personal_post, official_post, anonymous_post) and a
    residual set of one_on_one_chat "conversation starters" have no
    resolvable agent recipient at all (they target the public, or the data
    simply never specifies a counterpart). These are counted but excluded
    from the reply matrix, since a chord diagram needs a closed node set.
  - Message content also mentions plenty of non-agent @handles (external
    orgs, journalists, personal accounts like "@PropTechWatcher" or
    "@ElenaMarquez"). Only tokens that match a known agent role are kept;
    everything else is ignored. A mention of an agent's own role within its
    own message (rare, but occurs when a sender re-quotes a tag) is dropped
    since it isn't a cross-agent edge. Repeated tags of the same agent
    within a single message are also collapsed to one edge, so a message
    that says "@pr ... following up, @pr" still only counts once — the
    matrix counts *messages that mention*, not raw tag occurrences.

Output: agent_connections.json, containing the ordered agent list and three
directed weight matrices — reply_matrix, mention_matrix, and combined_matrix
(their elementwise sum) — plus flat edge lists for each of the two kinds. Each
edge carries the timestamp of the message it was resolved from (matching the
"timestamp" field on the corresponding node in the frontend's data.json,
since message_id and node id use the same scheme), so the frontend can filter
edges to whatever time window is currently in view without re-running Python.
